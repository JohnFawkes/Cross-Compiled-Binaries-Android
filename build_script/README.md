## Binaries for Android Build Script ##
Build script for cross compiling most of the binaries present in this repo

## Prerequisites

Linux - Tested on Arch-based distro. You could try this on other distros but your mileage may vary

### Prereq Setup ###
```
sudo pacman -S git libgit2 python-pip
pip install abimap
git clone https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts # Sets up build environment
cd scripts
bash setup/arch-manjaro.sh
cd ..
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi arm-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
cargo install cargo-ndk
```

## Generate Needed crt file for aria2
* Just copy the [ca-certificate.crt_gen.sh script](ca-certificate.crt_gen.sh) to your device and run it in terminal as su

## Build instructions

./build.bash --help # For more info on usage

## Issues
* Aria2 and Curl have weird DNS error in Android Q when not run as superuser (static compile only) - see notes on it below
* Sqlite3 static compile still ends up dynamically linked somehow
* Exa always statically compiles, limitation with rust
* Pwcat and Grcat (part of gawk) seg fault when ndk is used, compile without it to use them
* Iftop static compile segfaults
* Nmap arm64 won't compile static - always ends up dynamic linked somehow 

### DNS Issues
* Starting with oreo, new restrictions were placed on the net.dns# props.
  * So aria2, curl, whatever is unable to get the dns server without root
  * C-ares updated for that with an app permission [see here](https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/pull/148) but this only works for apps, not binaries and so c-ares will not resolve dns without root
  * Using native android threaded resolver will work fine when dynamic link but not static link
    * Maybe libc related or something? Not due to outdated libc in NDK based on my testing
      * Libc version on test device (OOS A11 - 11.0.2), NDK r21e (9.0.7), NDK r22 (11.0.4) - didn't work for either ndk static compile so probably not due to being out of date
* Best workaround currently: curl-alt and aria2-alt options when compiling with this script
  * Static link all non-android dependencies
  * Actual binary is dynamic linked with android binaries (libc, libm, libdl)
  * Only limitation is the minimum api of 26 which is fine because api of 26 and newer is where this problem occurs - older roms will be fine with static
* Other workaround for static compiles
  * Set alias with dns server arguments set (see the install.sh script in aria2 and curl folders) - need root to get the dns servers
