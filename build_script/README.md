## Binaries for Android Build Script ##
Build script for cross compiling most of the binaries present in this repo

## Prerequisites

Linux - Tested on Arch-based distro. You could try this on other distros but your mileage may vary

### Prereq Setup ###
```
sudo pacman -S git libgit2 # Needed for exa
git clone https://github.com/akhilnarang/scripts # Sets up build environment
cd scripts
bash setup/arch-manjaro.sh
cd ..
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh # Needed for exa
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android arm-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

## Build instructions

./build.bash --help # For more info on usage

## Issues
* Sqlite3 static compile still ends up dynamically linked somehow
* Exa static compile still ends up dynamically linked somehow
* Pwcat and Grcat (part of gawk) seg fault when ndk is used, compile without it to use them
* Coreutils won't build with selinux with dynamic link - static only
